title: Don't Adjust Your Screens
publication_date: 2024-04-16

Behold, the worst looking site ever?! The latest update to the website brings minimal HTML rendering -- giving it
an upgrade from just plain text. No CSS yet, hence some of the web-90's look. I'm still considering whether I want
to use something out-of-the-box like Razor Pages for HTML or roll something unique that uses a template language
like Liquid. TBD. For now, the single route handler that has been returning plain text now returns an HTML string.

This change also adds Markdown support. I'm currently using the [Markdig](https://github.com/xoofx/markdig) NuGet
package to translate Markdown to HTML. Markdown files are stored in a folder deployed with the website where entries
follow a convention that allows them to be sort-order appropriate: `YYYY-MM-DD.NN.title.md`, e.g.
`2024-04-16.01.dont_adjust_your_screens.md`. The number following the date is to allow multiple entries for the same
day.

I'm also using YAML front matter in the Markdown files to specify details like the title and publication date.
This entry has a YAML front matter like:

```yaml
---
title: Don't Adjust Your Screens
publication_date: 2024-04-16
---
```

The YAML isn't being properly parsed right now because I need to consider whether I like this front matter approach
and then settle on a YAML parsing library.

Here is the relevant code that takes Markdown files from the filesystem and renders them into an HTML block:

```csharp
app.MapGet("/", async (IHostEnvironment env) =>
{
    // Write start of HTML
    using var writer = new StringWriter();
    writer.WriteLine(_htmlStart);
    writer.Flush();

    var renderer = new HtmlRenderer(writer);
    pipeline.Setup(renderer);

    // Get Markdown files
    var files = env.ContentRootFileProvider.GetDirectoryContents("/Entries")
        .Where(f => f.Exists && f.Name.EndsWith(".md", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
        .Reverse();

    // Write each Markdown file as HTML
    foreach (var f in files)
    {
        using var stream = f.CreateReadStream();
        using var reader = new StreamReader(stream);

        var markdown = await reader.ReadToEndAsync();
        MarkdownDocument document = Markdown.Parse(markdown, pipeline);

        var yamlBlock = document.Descendants<YamlFrontMatterBlock>().First();
        var yaml = markdown.Substring(yamlBlock.Span.Start, yamlBlock.Span.Length);

        // Write entry header
        // TODO Properly parse YAML
        var title = Regex.Match(yaml, @"title:\s+(.*)").Groups[1].Value.Trim();
        var date = DateTimeOffset.Parse(Regex.Match(yaml, @"publication_date:\s+(.*)").Groups[1].Value.Trim());
        writer.WriteLine($"<h1>{title} - {date.LocalDateTime.ToShortDateString()}</h1>");
        writer.Flush();

        // Write entry HTML
        renderer.Render(document);
        writer.Flush();
    }

    // Write the end of HTML
    writer.WriteLine(_htmlEnd);

    return Results.Content(writer.ToString(), "text/html", Encoding.UTF8);
});
```

Yes, there are some serious warts and performance issues here. That's okay. I intentionally didn't address those yet to continue
in the theme of building this site step-by-step. One of the benefits of this approach is that the Markdown is read right off
the filesystem on demand, so adding new entries no longer requires a full deployment -- even if it is currently a DDOS concern.

I think I better get CSS working next before someone gets an eye injury.
